# fcalc
Just another fractional calculator.
it is a well-known floating math problem : `0.1 + 0.2 = 0.3` ?
See the answer - http://0.30000000000000004.com/

This is the way to awoid such problems - let's stay fractional as is and do the proper calculations!
Of course - this small script is done just for fun, but some times it could be really useful

Fraction should be presented as `x:y`, operations: `+ - * /`, for negation do like `(0 - x:y)`

```
$ ./fcalc.pl
> (1:3 - 7:4) * 2:3 - (5:7 + 1:3) / 3:5
-113:42
>
```
